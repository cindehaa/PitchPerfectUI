## Languages, Tools, and Technologies
The UI was built in Python and kvlang, using the Kivy framework.

## Features
###### This project currently only includes the app UI. Future plans involve developing the app into a musical pitch trainer, using spaced repetition to help users improve their pitch recognition.

* App layout is responsive to different screen sizes
* Includes a start screen with the app logo, and a start button
* Menu screen includes three buttons to navigate to the practice screen, test screen, or guide screen
* Practice screen features an icon that will play a sound, where the user must identify the pitch by choosing between 12 buttons labelled with note names
* Test screen includes a slider for the user to choose between 1 and 20 questions, and a start button for the test to commence
* Guide screen displays 12 buttons labelled with note names, to act as an accessible pitch reference for the user
